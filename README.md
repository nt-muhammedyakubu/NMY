*A design prototype and the HTML is provided to re-create
a similar card to resemble the prototype card. Style.css
is provided but individual design can be added to customise the
card. Image should be 300px wide, card should be 300px + spacing on either side.

- The HTML includes classes that are used for styling.
- Classes are given meaningful names.
- HTML is seperated from CSS by linking to stylesheet.
- HTML code does not include <style> elements or style attributes in the body.

##Adventure_game

*Project is an old adventure game where:

_ Prints describes what is happening to the player.
- The player is able to make a choice.
- The choice describe what the player will do next.
- The choice also determines whether the player will be defeated or victorious. 
- A valid input entered by the player else the next action will not
be displayed until a valid input is provided.
- The game is playable with different scenario for the player depending on his choice.
- Provides functions to describe what happen in each scenario.
- The use of random module (random.choice) came into play to set the creatures
the player encounter.
- The player is able to declare if he wants to play again or not.
- Pycodestyle is used to check whether the code has any issue.

##Code type

- Python

##Code quality

- The code is printed to the console for the player to see.
- The time.sleep function is used to create delays between messages so that they are not all printed at once.
- The random.choice function is used to influence the game so that each game is different in some way.
- The input function is used to ask the player what they would like to do.
- The player's choices affect what happens in the game, including:

* whether player wins or loses
* Whether to restart or exit after the game is over

- If the player enters a choice that is not valid, the game gives them the chance to retry until a valid option is provided_ 
- The game does not crash and does not treat invalid input as a valid choice
- The code includes at least four function definitions that are used to improve the code in some way, such as by:

Reducing repetition
Reducing complexity
Improving the readability or organization of the code

- Each function has a single purpose and a name that describes that purpose.
- The pycodestyle tool reports zero errors and zero warnings.
- The program is a playable game, and runs from start to finish without crashing or displaying errors.
